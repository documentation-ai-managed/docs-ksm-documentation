## Best Practices

Organize documentation hierarchically: Use frontmatter for metadata, H2 headings for sections, and components for interactivity.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Example: API integration in docs
  const apiKey = process.env.KSM_API_KEY;
  fetch('https://api.ksm.dev/docs', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}` }
  });
  ```
  ```python
  # Example: Embed docs in app
  import requests
  api_key = os.getenv('KSM_API_KEY')
  response = requests.get('https://api.ksm.dev/docs', headers={
      'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Expandable title="Structuring Large Workspaces" default-open="false">

1. Create a `reference/` folder for APIs.
2. Use `tutorials/` for guides.
3. Pin changelog.mdx to the top.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Limit pages to 2000 words for faster rendering.
</Callout>
